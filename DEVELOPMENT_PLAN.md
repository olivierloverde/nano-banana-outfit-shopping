## 3. Frontend Development Details

### Infinite Scroll Implementation:
- Use React Intersection Observer API or react-window for virtualization
- Implement progressive image loading with placeholder blurring
- Batch API requests to fetch 20-30 images per scroll trigger
- Implement skeleton loading states for smooth UX

```typescript
// Infinite scroll hook structure
const useInfiniteScroll = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [hasMore, setHasMore] = useState(true);
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  
  const fetchMore = useCallback(async () => {
    // Fetch next batch of images
  }, []);
}
```

### Mobile-First Design Considerations:
- Viewport meta tag for proper mobile rendering
- Touch-friendly interface with 44px minimum touch targets
- Swipe gestures for navigation between outfit details
- Responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2-3 columns tablet+)
- Performance-optimized images with WebP format and multiple sizes

### Individual Model Picture Display:
- Modal overlay for detailed view on mobile
- Side panel for tablet/desktop
- Image zoom functionality with pinch-to-zoom support
- Outfit breakdown section showing individual pieces
- Call-to-action buttons for shopping and sharing

---

## 4. Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview Integration

### API Setup and Configuration:
- Obtain Google AI Studio API key for Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Implement server-side API calls to protect API keys
- Set up request rate limiting and error handling
- Configure image preprocessing for optimal results

### Implementation Process:

```typescript
// Backend service for Gemini integration
class GeminiService {
  async convertToFlatLay(imageUrl: string): Promise<FlatLayResult> {
    const prompt = "convert the outfit into a flat lay outfit";
    const response = await geminiClient.generateContent({
      contents: [{
        parts: [
          { text: prompt },
          { inline_data: { mime_type: "image/jpeg", data: imageBuffer } }
        ]
      }]
    });
    return this.parseGeminiResponse(response);
  }
}
```

### Workflow Integration:
- Trigger flat lay conversion when user selects a model image
- Display loading state during API processing (2-5 seconds typical)
- Cache results to avoid repeated API calls for same images
- Implement fallback handling for API failures
- Store converted images for future reference

### Result Processing:
- Parse Gemini response for flat lay image generation
- Implement image quality validation
- Store processed results in database with original image reference
- Create responsive image variants for different screen sizes

---

## 5. Google Lens Integration

### API Setup:
- Configure Google Cloud Vision API for product search
- Set up Google Shopping API for price comparisons
- Implement Google Lens REST API integration
- Configure product database for item matching

### Implementation Strategy:

```typescript
// Google Lens service integration
class GoogleLensService {
  async identifyOutfitPieces(flatLayImage: string): Promise<OutfitPiece[]> {
    const visionClient = new ImageAnnotatorClient();
    const [result] = await visionClient.productSearch({
      image: { content: flatLayImage },
      features: [{ type: 'PRODUCT_SEARCH', maxResults: 10 }],
      imageContext: {
        productSearchParams: {
          productSet: 'fashion-items-product-set',
          productCategories: ['apparel-v2']
        }
      }
    });
    return this.parseProductResults(result);
  }
}
```

### Shopping Integration Process:
- Segment flat lay image to identify individual pieces
- Use Google Lens to identify each clothing item
- Cross-reference with shopping APIs (Amazon, Shopify, etc.)
- Provide price ranges and availability information
- Implement affiliate link integration for monetization

### User Experience Flow:
- Display identified pieces with confidence scores
- Allow users to select specific items to shop for
- Show similar items when exact matches aren't available
- Provide size and color variations
- Include user reviews and ratings integration

## 6. Backend and Database Architecture

### Database Schema Design:

```sql
-- Core tables structure
CREATE TABLE models (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    original_source TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE outfits (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    model_id UUID REFERENCES models(id),
    flat_lay_url TEXT,
    gemini_processed_at TIMESTAMP,
    style_tags TEXT[],
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE outfit_pieces (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    outfit_id UUID REFERENCES outfits(id),
    piece_type VARCHAR(100), -- 'shirt', 'pants', 'shoes', etc.
    confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2),
    bounding_box JSONB, -- coordinates for piece location
    google_lens_data JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE shopping_items (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    outfit_piece_id UUID REFERENCES outfit_pieces(id),
    product_name VARCHAR(255),
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    currency CHAR(3) DEFAULT 'USD',
    affiliate_url TEXT,
    retailer VARCHAR(100),
    availability_status VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

- **Minimal Cognitive Load:** Clear hierarchy, limited options per screen

### Key Interface Components:

#### Homepage Feed:
- Card-based layout with model images
- Skeleton loading placeholders during scroll
- Quick action overlay on hover/tap (heart, share, shop)
- Search and filter bar (sticky on scroll)
- Infinite scroll with "Load More" fallback

#### Outfit Detail Modal:
- Full-screen modal on mobile, sidebar on desktop
- Image carousel with zoom functionality
- Tabbed interface: "Original" → "Flat Lay" → "Shop Items"
- Floating action buttons for save/share
- Breadcrumb navigation for complex flows

#### Shopping Interface:
- Grid layout of identified pieces

## 8. Performance Optimization

### Image Loading Optimization:
- **Lazy Loading:** Intersection Observer API for images entering viewport
- **Progressive Image Loading:** Blur-up technique with low-quality placeholders
- **WebP Format:** Modern format with 25-30% smaller file sizes
- **Responsive Images:** Multiple resolutions using srcset attribute
- **CDN Implementation:** CloudFront or CloudFlare for global distribution

```typescript
// Image optimization strategy
const ImageOptimizer = {
  generateSizes: (width: number) => [
    { width: width * 0.25, quality: 20 }, // placeholder
    { width: width * 0.5, quality: 75 },  // mobile
    { width: width, quality: 85 },        // full size
  ],
  
  prefetchStrategy: (viewportImages: Image[]) => {
    // Preload next 3-5 images in scroll direction
  }
}
```

### API Performance:
- **Request Batching:** Combine multiple API calls into single requests
- **Caching Strategy:** Redis for frequently accessed data (30min-24hr TTL)
- **Database Optimization:** Proper indexing on search columns
- **Rate Limiting:** Protect APIs from abuse (100 requests/minute/user)
- **Background Processing:** Queue system for Gemini/Google Lens processing

### Frontend Performance:
- **Code Splitting:** Route-based splitting with Next.js dynamic imports
- **Bundle Analysis:** Webpack analyzer to identify large dependencies  
- **Service Worker:** Cache static assets and API responses
- **Virtual Scrolling:** Handle large lists efficiently
- **Debounced Search:** 300ms delay for search input

### Monitoring and Metrics:
- Core Web Vitals tracking (LCP, CLS, FID)
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) with Sentry
- API response time monitoring
- Image load time analytics
- Infinite scroll performance metrics
